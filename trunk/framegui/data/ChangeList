- 	Renamed framgui module as mainwindow to avoid module / package name 
	collisions

- 	Removed hard-coded yaml file paths from FrameGUIWindow constructor and
	added new parameter files -> initial yaml file locations can be provided as
	a string list from main()
	
-	self.tabNameList is redundant -> self.tools holds tool names as keys and
	gui widgets as values -> tool names can be accessed with self.tools.keys()  
	
-	Modifications to add_tool():
		-   loading errors are now logged correctly
